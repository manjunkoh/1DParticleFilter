# Acknowledgement 
I would like to thank Drs. Heng Xiao and Mark L. Psiaki for allowing me to take their courses as an undergrad; it led me to have a passion for this field and dothis semester project. <br/>
I would also like to thank my good friend Matt Marti for the guidance along the way. 

To Wi, 

Feels like yesterday when we talked about this at Sharkey's about how you were very excited to see this project finish. I will regret forever not finishing sooner. <br/>
To so many people you brought happiness beyond measure, colors we didn't see before, and personality warmer than a fireplace on rainy days. <br/>
Your kind spirit will echo through all of us in eternity. <br/>
Fly high brother.
